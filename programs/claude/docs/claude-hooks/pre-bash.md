# `pre-bash` — Allowed & Forbidden Command Patterns

A `PreToolUse` hook that auto-approves or blocks Bash commands based on configurable patterns.

## Setup

Add to your `settings.json` (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `.claude/settings.local.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "claude-hooks pre-bash"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Add a `preBash` section to your `.claude/nownabe-claude-hooks.json`. Patterns are specified as an object keyed by pattern string.

### Allowed Patterns

Allowed patterns auto-approve matching commands, bypassing Claude Code's permission system (including bash security heuristics like the multi-line command check). This is useful for commands that are known-safe but trigger false positives.

```json
{
  "preBash": {
    "allowedPatterns": {
      "git commit *": {
        "reason": "Allow git commit with multi-line messages",
        "multiline": true
      },
      "deno test *": {},
      "deno task *": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Each entry supports:

| Field       | Required | Description                                                               |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reason`    | No       | Displayed to the user when the command is allowed                         |
| `type`      | No       | `"glob"` (default) or `"regex"`                                           |
| `multiline` | No       | When `true`, `*` and `.` also match newline characters (default: `false`) |

**Evaluation order:** Forbidden patterns are checked **before** allowed patterns. If a command matches a forbidden pattern, it is denied regardless of any allowed patterns. This ensures explicit deny rules always take precedence.

### Forbidden Patterns

```json
{
  "preBash": {
    "forbiddenPatterns": {
      "git -C *": {
        "reason": "git -C is not allowed",
        "suggestion": "Run git commands from the working directory directly"
      },
      "git push --force *": {
        "reason": "Force push is dangerous",
        "suggestion": "Use --force-with-lease instead"
      },
      "rm -rf /*": {
        "reason": "Dangerous delete from root",
        "suggestion": "Be more specific about the target path"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Pattern Types

Two pattern formats are supported. Patterns are treated as **glob by default**; wrap in `/` delimiters for regex, or use the `type` field for explicit control.

### Glob Patterns (Default, Claude Code Style)

| Pattern        | Matches                               | Does not match  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `git commit *` | `git commit -m msg`, `git commit`     | `git commitall` |
| `git*`         | `git`, `gitk`, `git status`           |                 |
| `git * main`   | `git checkout main`, `git merge main` | `git main`      |
| `* --version`  | `node --version`, `deno --version`    |                 |
| `git commit:*` | Same as `git commit *` (deprecated)   |                 |

### Regex Patterns

Wrap in `/` delimiters (like JavaScript), optionally with flags:

| Pattern                 | Matches                               | Equivalent glob |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `/^git commit(\s.*)?$/` | `git commit -m msg`, `git commit`     | `git commit *`  |
| `/^git/`                | `git`, `gitk`, `git status`           | `git*`          |
| `/^git\s.*main$/`       | `git checkout main`, `git merge main` | `git * main`    |
| `/\bgit\s+-C\b/`        | `git -C /tmp status`                  |                 |
| `/curl/i`               | `curl`, `CURL`, `Curl`                |                 |

### Explicit `type` Field

You can also set `"type": "glob"` or `"type": "regex"` to override auto-detection. This is useful when the pattern key itself would be ambiguous (e.g., a regex without `/` delimiters or a glob path containing `/`):

```json
{
  "preBash": {
    "forbiddenPatterns": {
      "\\bgit\\s*push\\b": {
        "type": "regex",
        "reason": "Direct push is not allowed",
        "suggestion": "Use a pull request instead"
      },
      "/usr/local/*": {
        "type": "glob",
        "reason": "Do not modify /usr/local",
        "suggestion": "Use a different path"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security: Why Allowed Patterns Are Safe

Claude Code's built-in bash security heuristic blocks commands containing "a quoted newline followed by a `#`-prefixed line" (CVE-2025-66032). This prevents a **parser differential attack** where Claude Code's line-based permission checker and bash disagree on how to parse a command:

```bash
safe_command "arg
#" dangerous_command
```

A line-based checker sees line 2 as a comment, but bash treats `"arg\n#"` as a single quoted argument — meaning `dangerous_command` silently passes the permission check.

This heuristic is intentionally broad, so it also blocks legitimate multi-line commands like:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add feature

#123 fix related issue"
```

**`pre-bash` is not vulnerable to this attack** because it matches against the **entire command string**, not line-by-line. The attack pattern above would never match `git commit *` since the full string includes `dangerous_command`. Meanwhile, a real multi-line git commit message matches correctly when `"multiline": true` is set.

To safely allow multi-line commands, enable `multiline` on specific patterns that need it:

```json
{
  "preBash": {
    "allowedPatterns": {
      "git commit *": { "multiline": true },
      "gh pr *": { "multiline": true }
    }
  }
}
```

Without `"multiline": true`, patterns only match single-line commands. This is the safer default — only opt in to multi-line matching for patterns where you need it.

### Compound Command Safety

For compound commands (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`), allowed patterns require **all** sub-commands to match. This prevents injection like:

```bash
rm -rf / && git commit -m "innocent"
```

Here `rm -rf /` does not match any allowed pattern, so the entire command is not auto-approved.

## Shell Operator Awareness

Commands are split on shell operators (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`) and each sub-command is checked independently. This means a pattern like `safe-cmd malicious-cmd` will not match `safe-cmd && malicious-cmd`.

## Multiple Pattern Matching

When a command matches multiple forbidden patterns, all matching patterns are reported at once. This allows Claude to see every violated rule in a single response and adjust accordingly, rather than hitting them one at a time on retries.

## Config Merging

Both `allowedPatterns` and `forbiddenPatterns` are objects, so patterns from parent and child directories are deep merged. Child directories can:

- **Add** new patterns alongside inherited ones
- **Override** an inherited pattern's reason/suggestion
- **Disable** an inherited pattern:

```json
{
  "preBash": {
    "allowedPatterns": {
      "git commit *": { "disabled": true }
    },
    "forbiddenPatterns": {
      "git push --force *": { "disabled": true }
    }
  }
}
```

## Private Patterns

Beyond the config, `pre-bash` enforces the machine-local private patterns described in
[`private-patterns.md`](private-patterns.md) — but only on sub-commands that publish text:
`gh pr|issue|release|repo|gist|api` and `git commit|tag|merge|notes`. Cloning a private remote or
grepping for its name publishes nothing and is left alone. The check is skipped when the session's
working directory belongs to a private repository.
